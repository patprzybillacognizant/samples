2.2.8.2.1 Documentation for Noninvasive Electrical Bone Growth Stimulator
Documentation of one of the following is required for prior authorization of the external, electromagnetic
bone stimulator (procedure code E0747):
• Nonunions, failed fusions, and congenital pseudarthrosis where there is no evidence of progression
of healing for three or more months despite appropriate fracture care.
• Delayed unions of fractures of failed arthrodesis at high-risk sites (e.g., open or segmental tibial
fractures, carpal navicular fractures).
Documentation must also indicate all the following:
• Serial radiographs have confirmed that no progressive signs of healing have occurred.
• The fractured gap is 1 cm or less.
• The individual can be adequately immobilized and is likely to comply with non-weight-bearing
restrictions.
Documentation of one of the following is required for prior authorization of the external, electromagnetic
bone stimulator for spinal application (procedure code E0748):
• One or more failed fusions.
• Grade II or worse spondylolisthesis.
• A multiple-level fusion with extensive bone grafting is required.
• Other risk factors for fusion failure are present, including gross obesity, degenerative osteoarthritis,
severe spondylolisthesis, current smoking, previous fusion surgery, previous disc surgery, or gross
instability.

2.2.8.2.2 Documentation for Invasive Electrical Bone Growth Stimulators
Documentation of one of the following is required for prior authorization of the surgically implanted
bone growth stimulator (procedure code E0749):
• Nonunion of long bone fractures (i.e., clavicle, humerus, radius, ulna, femur, tibia, fibula, and
metacarpal, metatarsal, carpal, and tarsal bones). Nonunion of long bone fractures is considered to
exist only when serial radiographs have confirmed that fracture healing has ceased for three or more
months prior to starting treatment with the bone growth stimulator. Serial radiographs must
include a minimum of two sets of radiographs separated by a minimum of 90 days. Each set of radiographs
must include multiple views of the fracture site.
• Failed fusion of a joint other than the spine when a minimum of three months has elapsed since the
joint fusion was performed.
• Congenital pseudoarthrosis.
• An adjunct to spinal fusion surgery for patients at high risk for pseudoarthrosis due to previously
failed spinal fusion at the same site.
• An adjunct to multiple-level fusion, which involves three or more vertebrae (e.g., L3-L5, L4-S1, etc).
2.2.8.2.3 Documentation for Ultrasound Bone Growth Stimulator
Documentation of the following is required for prior authorization of the external, low-intensity ultrasound
bone growth stimulator device (procedure code E0760):
• Nonunion of a fracture, other than the skull or vertebrae, in a skeletally mature person, which is
documented by a minimum of two sets of radiographs that were:
• Obtained prior to starting treatment with the bone growth stimulator.
• Separated by a minimum of 90 days.
• Taken with multiple views of the fracture site.
• Accompanied by a written interpretation by a physician who states that there has been no clinically
significant evidence of fracture healing between the two set of radiographs.
• Evidence of all of the following:
• The fracture is not tumor related.
• The fracture is not fresh (less than seven days), closed or grade I open, tibial diaphyseal fractures,
or closed fractures of the distal radius (Colles fracture).
